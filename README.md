# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

Here are my solutions in Bash. Every day includes a `dayXX.sh` file (the solution), and an `input.txt` file (the data input). The `dayXX.sh` file can be executed directly in a terminal as long as the `input.txt` file is in the same directory. I am not sure Bash (with my skill level in Bash) will be fast enough to do Advent of Code, however I will give it a try.

I only aim for solving part 1 of each day this year (one star). If a day would also have a solution for part two (two stars), this will be present as a second `dayXXp2.sh` file.

Best of luck! ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶
