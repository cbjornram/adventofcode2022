Here are my solutions in Bash. Every day includes a `.sh` file (the solution) and a `.txt` file (the data input). The `.sh` file can be executed directly in a terminal as long as the `.txt` file is in the same directory. I am not sure Bash (with my skill level in Bash) will be fast enough to do Advent of Code, however I will give it a try.

I only aim for solving part 1 of each day this year (one star). If a day would also have a solution for part two (two stars), this will be present as a second `.sh` file.

Best of luck! ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶
